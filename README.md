 ## Getting Started
 
 Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
 
 ### Prerequisites
 
 You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later recommended) and npm installed on your machine.
 
 ### Installation
 
 1.  **Clone the repository:**
 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/0xYurii/startup_planet.git
     cd startup_planet
     ```
 
 2.  **Install dependencies:**
 
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
 
 ## Usage
 
 To run the server in development mode with automatic reloading (thanks to `nodemon`), use:
 
 ```bash
 npm run dev
 ```
 
 To run the server in production mode, use:
 
 ```bash
 npm start
 ```
 
 The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
 
 ## API Endpoints
 
 The base URL for all API endpoints is `/api`.
 
 ### 1. Get All Startups
 
 Retrieves a list of all startups. You can filter the results using query parameters.
 
 -   **Endpoint:** `GET /api`
 -   **Query Parameters:**
     -   `industry` (string): Filter by industry.
     -   `country` (string): Filter by country.
     -   `continent` (string): Filter by continent.
     -   `is_seeking_funding` (boolean): Filter by funding status (`true` or `false`).
     -   `has_mvp` (boolean): Filter by MVP status (`true` or `false`).
 
 **Example Request:**
 
 ```http
 GET /api?industry=AI&country=USA
 ```
 
 **Example Response:**
 
 ```json
 [
   {
     "id": 1,
     "name": "TechNova AI",
     "industry": "AI",
     "founded": 2021,
     "country": "USA",
     "continent": "North America",
     // ... other fields
   }
 ]
 ```
 
 ### 2. Filter Startups by Field
 
 Retrieves startups that match a specific term within an allowed field.
 
 -   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/:field/:term`
 -   **URL Parameters:**
     -   `field` (string): The field to search in. Allowed fields are `country`, `continent`, `industry`.
     -   `term` (string): The value to search for.
 
 **Example Request:**
 
 ```http
 GET /api/country/Germany
 ```
 
 **Example Response:**
 
 ```json
 [
   {
     "id": 2,
     "name": "GreenGrid Energy",
     "industry": "Renewable Energy",
     "founded": 2018,
     "country": "Germany",
     "continent": "Europe",
     // ... other fields
   },
   {
     "id": 9,
     "name": "Visionary Network",
     "industry": "Healthcare",
     "founded": 2016,
     "country": "Germany",
     "continent": "Europe",
     // ... other fields
   }
 ]
 ```
 
 ### Error Handling
 
 If you request an invalid endpoint or use a disallowed search field, the API will return a JSON error message with an appropriate status code (e.g., `404 Not Found` or `400 Bad Request`).
